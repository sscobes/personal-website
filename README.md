# Personal Website

Personal website to mirror my resume and also give more insight to who I am. Built using React, Express for Node, and Tailwind CSS. 

Currently a work in progress as I learn more about Tailwind functionality and derust on React components.

# Demo
Run a live local demo of the in process site by cloning the repository and then running ```npm run start```
